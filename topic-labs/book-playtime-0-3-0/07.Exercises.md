# Exercises

This is the Playtime application at the end if this lab:

- [playtime-0.3.0.zip](archives/playtime-0.3.0.zip)

## Exercise 1: Schemas

Currently we have just the Signup form validated. We have 3 other forms that can also be equipped with this:

- Login
- Add Playlist
- Add Track

You will need additional Schemas to specific acceptable values for these forms, Perhaps call these :

- UserCredentialsSpec
- TrackSpec
- PlaylistSpec

... and place them in `joi-schemas.js`

## Exercise 2: Introduce Joi validation into the remaining forms 

This will require introducing validate objects into the following actions:

- accountsControler.login
- dashboardController.addPlaylist
- playlistController.addTrack

You can follow the `accountsController.signup` action to the structure of this object:

~~~javascript
  signup: {
    auth: false,
    validate: {
      payload: UserSpec,
      options: { abortEarly: false },
      failAction: function (request, h, error) {
        return h.view("signup-view", { title: "Sign up error", errors: error.details }).takeover().code(400);
      },
    },
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      const user = request.payload;
      await db.userStore.addUser(user);
      return h.redirect("/");
    },
  },
~~~
