# Nodemon

Before continuing to evolve the API, we can make the development experience a little more convenient. Having to restart the server every time we make a change to its implementation can be a drag when practicing TDD. Nodemon is a tool that can help out here:

> nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

### Mac/Linux

First, install it as a developer dependency:

~~~bash
npm install -D nodemon
~~~

This will install nodemon in node_modules, listing it under **devDepencencies**:

### package.json

~~~json
  "devDependencies": {
    ...
    "nodemon": "^2.0.20",
    ...
  }
~~~

We can then introduce a new script in package.json

~~~json
  "scripts": {
    ... 
    "dev": "./node_modules/.bin/nodemon  src/server.js",
    ...  
  },
~~~

Remember, an attribute listed here can be run from the command line, as in:

~~~bash
npm run dev
~~~

### Windows

One option is to install nodemon globally:

~~~bash
npm install -g nodemon
~~~

This mean our script can rely on it being on the global path:

~~~json
scripts": {
    ... 
    "dev": "nodemon  src/server.js",
    ...  
  },
~~~

### Alternative: npx

An alternative to the above, which will work on all platforms:

~~~json
  "scripts": {
    ... 
    "dev": "npx nodemon  src/server.js",
    ...  
  },
~~~

Npx is a package runner:

- <https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-npx-nodejs-package-runner>

When it encounters a package it does not recognise, it search local node_modules and run from there, alternatively it will install globally, and then run.

With either of these techniques, we get a new command for launching the app:

~~~bash
npm run dev

> playtime@0.7.0 dev
> ./node_modules/.bin/nodemon  src/server.js

[nodemon] 2.0.20
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node src/server.js`
Server running on http://localhost:3000
database connected to playtime on localhost
~~~

Any changes to the source - say an implementation of one of our new endpoints - will be detected by nodemon, and the app will be relaunched automatically:

~~~javascript
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node src/server.js`
Server running on http://localhost:3000
database connected to playtime on localhost
~~~

### Watch

Node 18.11.0 now comes with a nodemon type feature *watch*, which would seem to cover what nodemon does comfortably:
