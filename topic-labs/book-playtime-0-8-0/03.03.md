# Inert

Currently our HAPI app does not support static resources like images very well. If we wanted to introduce an image, we would have to consider writing a special controller to serve up the image. This would get complex, as we would have to start supporting wildcards in image names if it was to be useful.

Vision has a companion plugin called Inert for this task:

- <https://hapi.dev/module/inert>

Start by installing it:

~~~bash
npm install @hapi/inert
~~~

In server, the plugin needs to be imported and initialised :

### server.js

~~~javascript
import Inert from "@hapi/inert";
...
  await server.register(Inert);
...
~~~

In your our web-routes add an additional wild card pattern as the last route:

### web-routes.js

~~~javascript
  { method: "GET", path: "/{param*}", handler: { directory: { path: "./public" } }, options: { auth: false } }
~~~

We have specified **public** as the folder to contain assets. Create this folder now and include an image you would like to include on one of the views:

In main.hbs introduce an image to test:

### main.hbs

~~~handlebars
{{> welcome-menu}}

<div class="columns is-vcentered ">
  <div class="column has-text-centered">
    <h> Sign up or Log in... </h>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="/images/cloud-img.jpg">
  </div>
</div>
~~~
